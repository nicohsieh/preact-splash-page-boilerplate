# preact-splash-page-boilerplate

This is a simple light weight boilerplate using Preact. It aims for static splash pages or social bounce pages that need to be very light and don't require complexity like routes or global states. The out of box compiled js from the boilerplate is 11k, including Preact and the demo code.

The boilerplate includes 
- Preact (chosen for the small size)
- Babel (ES6 transpile)
