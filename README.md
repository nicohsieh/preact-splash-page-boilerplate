# Preact Splash Page Boilerplate

üïäÔ∏è This is a simple light weight boilerplate with Preact and powered by Webpack. It aims for static splash pages or social bounce pages that need to be very light and don't require complexity like routes or global states.
<br />

This boilerplate includes:

- [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) (chosen for the small lib size)
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (ES6 and JSX transpile)
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)
  <br />
